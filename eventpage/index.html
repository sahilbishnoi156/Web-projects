        <p>These cats will be the showrunners this year. George has a long history in cat events, and is looking forward to this year's Cat Fancy Event. Sam is a world-class runner, and will be showing his new techniques. Doug likes to lay around, and will practice his abilities. Sally was invited because her mom made a fit about not coming.</p>
